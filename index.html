<h1 style="font-size:60px;">Heading 1</h1>
<p>this paragraph is going to be about how this is my last period of the year of my education at CCA..</p>
  This is literally thr last day of my senior year ... and then i am officailly off to the next step in my life.
  i cant say i am going to miss this place but i will say i am going to miss the people of the school. They have 
  all helped me grow in my spiritual walk with God... I am going to really miss the friendhships and all the laughs
  we share everyday since 8th grade. I am very thankful that i even get to talk about me gradutuating because most 
  people dont have this opportunity. I have so much happiness right now just because i am finally graduating.!!!!!!
